## Description

The Tech Quiz application is a MERN stack-based web app that allows users to test their knowledge by taking a quiz of ten random questions. Users can view their final score at the end of the quiz and restart the quiz to try again. This project emphasizes the importance of testing by incorporating Cypress for both component and end-to-end tests.
